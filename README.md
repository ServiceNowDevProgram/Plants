# Plants

Let's create a new plant app! Should we track the plants we have? Track when they were watered, how healthy they are, what kind of fertilizer they like? Where do they live?

## Contribution ideas

- Automate task creation for watering, fertilizing, etc
- Create an experience to be able to manage your plants
- Bring in plant data from other sources
- Create a way to track plant progress over time
- Add potting information (size, type, when it was repotted, soil type, etc)
- Plant location (indoor, distance to window, outdoor, in the ground? in a pot?)
- Look at the local weather, did it rain today? If so, log the outdoor plants as watered
